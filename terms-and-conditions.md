# Terms & Conditions 

These terms and conditions apply to those who download or use the GroceryCat application, from now on referred to as the "Service" or the "App".

By downloading or using the Service, these terms will automatically apply to you; you should therefore read them carefully before using the Service. 

## Prohibitions

The App and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, belong to Iron Llama. 

You may not:

* copy, or modify the App, any part of the App, or our trademarks, in any way
* decompile, disassemble, reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of, the App
* translate all or part of the App into other languages
* make derivative versions of the App

## Changes to the Service

Iron Llama is committed to ensuring that the Service is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the Service or to charge for it, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the Service without making it clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

The Service stores and processes personal data in the manner set out in the Privacy Policy, which is available at the same location as this Terms and Conditions document.

## Security

It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features, or stop the Service from working properly or at all. 

## Third Parties

The Service is made available through Google, who have their own terms of service which you should read: 

* [The Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms)

## Limitations of responsibility

The Service is provided "as-is", and does not make any warranties or guarantees, express or implied, including, but not limited to, warranties or guarantees of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or absence of bugs and defects. Iron Llama accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.

Computer software (such as an Android app) is rarely free of defects or errors, and Iron Llama makes no promise that the Service will be bug-free or error-free. Whilst we wish to provide a smooth and functional user experience as part of the Service, we cannot promise to fix bugs or errors in the Service, or to provide any additional features requested by users.

At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Iron Llama does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. 

We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device. 

## Changes to these Terms and Conditions

We may update these Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page. These Terms and Conditions are effective as of 2020-05-29
